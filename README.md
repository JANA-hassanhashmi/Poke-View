# Poke-View
PokeView is a web application that allows users to explore detailed information about Pokémon. Inspired by the aesthetic and design principles of Nintendo's 2008 DS games, PokeView presents Pokémon data in an engaging and user-friendly interface.

Built using React and TypeScript, PokeView pulls data from the official Pokémon API (Pokémon API) as well as a few other reliable sources to provide up-to-date information about Pokémon species, abilities, stats, and more.
